**create and tag surveys that need to be dropped**
generate byte drop_survey = 0
label variable drop_survey "Surveys that were incorrectly filled out, 1 = drop 0 = keep"

**Run all variables based on the characteristics of the individuals**


**Willingness to pay WTP calculations**
**STEP 1: Create time variable that sets time = 5,10,or 15 depending on the package**
generate int time = 0
label variable time "Willingness to pay amount of time, 5, 10, or 15 hours per week"
replace time = 5 if time_5 ==1
replace time =10 if time_10 ==10
replace time = 15 if time_15 == 15
**taking current situation out of the analysis because no way of showing it as a value, so code as missing**
replace time =. if alt ==3
**Create a table showing time, alt, and choice_no***
table time alt, by (choice_no) contents(freq)


**STEP 2: Calculate WTP variable**
**Make sure that you download wtp by searching for "wtp" and scrolling down to "wtp" and downloading it**
wtp time tech_phone


**Alternative for WTP calculations, the Krinsky method**

wtpcikr time_5
wtpcikr time_10
wtpcikr time_15


**How much time are participants willing to pay for an incentive (Willingness-to-pay analysis)**

**Probability that an incentive will be chosen (Market share prediction)**

**Change in participants' situation fter having implemented the new incentive (Welfare analysis)**
